# githubActionsTest

Testing out Github Actions.

Created a small series of VBScripts that open Notepad, focus the cursor on Notepad, type a simple message, and save the times for each step to c: drive.
The idea I am hoping for is to click run and have the other scripts do their thing.
This would be a basis for automating DVE, where I would have several VBScripts running sequentially.  

Also, I would experiment here to see if the thing could be put on a timed schedule.
